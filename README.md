# distributed-system
This is a submodule of [distributed-bitmap-engine](https://github.com/Puget-Sound-Bitmaps/distributed-bitmap-engine).
## Setup
You will need a list of all the IP addresses of the slave nodes, listed line by
line in a file called SLAVELIST in the toplevel folder. (There is a shell script
in the parent module for generating these automatically)
